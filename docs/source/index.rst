Welcome to Atom

Atom is a framework for creating memory efficient Python objects with enhanced 
features such as dynamic initialization, validation, and change notification for 
object attributes. It provides the default model binding behaviour for the
`Enaml <http://nucleic.github.io/enaml/docs>`_ UI framework.

        if you are interested in extending Atom for your own custom needs.

      - :doc:`examples/index`

        "Just show me the code!" This section provides an easy-to-browse
        alternative to running Atom's examples from the command line.

        "Use the source, Luke." When all else fails, consult the API docs to
        find the answer you need. The API docs also include convenient links
        to the most definitive Atom documentation: the source.
